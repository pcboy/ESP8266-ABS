# ESP8266-ABS
A Lightweight ESP8266 Wifi AccessPoint Beacon Spammer based on [H-LK/ESP8266-SSID-Text-Broadcast](https://github.com/H-LK/ESP8266-SSID-Text-Broadcast). The objective of this code is to spam 802.11 beacon frames with arbitrary SSID tag. 

The code includes two lists of SSIDs, one is a list of countries, and the other was was collected from [this AskReddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/70gkke/what_is_the_best_name_youve_seen_for_wifi/).

### Features (differences from H-LK's repository):

  - Arbitrary SSID tag length without padding. (don't forget to change the number of APs at lines 14 and 15)
  - Fixed one char prefix ('#'). Can be removed by modifying lines 18, 19, 38 and 58.
  - SRC and BSSID pinning. Some devices await for a few beacons in a minimum amount of time before showing it to the user. So while the program is running the SSID will always use the same SRC/BSSID. I also tested with channel pinning but it gave me bad results whenever it synced up with the device's channel scanning routine.

# Notes
 - Tested on NodeMCU (ESP12E) and Wemos D1 mini Pro.  
 - Working on ESP8266 Community 2.3.0.
 - The execution of this code might be illegal in your country.
